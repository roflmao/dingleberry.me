				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I got myself a new bodyscale recently. Ofcourse it had to be something of a gadget so I went for this <a title="Withings BodyScale" href="http://withings.com/en/bodyscale">Withings BodyScale</a>. Withings allready has a nice webpage with graphs and stuff and also a couple of really nice iphone/ipad apps for it. The fact that it is integrated with other services like Runkeeper and such, made me think about if they had an API i could query. And it had. Also a quick search for &#8220;python withings api&#8221; gave some results with examples on how to use it.</p>
<p>I came across this thing : <a title="https://github.com/mote/python-withings" href="https://github.com/mote/python-withings">https://github.com/mote/python-withings</a> &#8230;and then it was pretty much just about writing a bit of nagios-logic around it to make it into a plugin.</p>
<p>The first result is here: <a title="https://github.com/mortis1337/check_wife" href="https://github.com/mortis1337/check_wife">https://github.com/mortis1337/check_wife</a></p>
<p>The script takes a userid, an apikey and a name as arguments.</p>
<p>$ ./check_wife.py Â -u 1111111 -k xxxxxxxxxxxxx -n Your(or your wife&#8217;s;)name<br />
WARNING: &lt;yourname&gt;&#8217;s overweight. Size: &lt;yoursize&gt; &#8211; Weight: &lt;yourweight&gt; BMI: &lt;yourbmi&gt;</p>
<p>The script will give a WARNING whenever the BMI-value is about 25 or below 18,5.</p>
<p>Add this to your nagios-config and your operators can come point and laugh at you whenever a WARNING occurs <img src="http://dingleberry.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>( yes, the &#8220;wife&#8221;-part is a joke&#8230;. go monitor your own weight;) )</p>
