		<description><![CDATA[Hello, I was just visiting your site and filled out your &quot;contact us&quot; form. The contact page on your site sends you these messages via email which is the reason you&#039;re reading through my message right now correct? This is the most important accomplishment with any kind of online ad, getting people to actually READ your advertisement and I did that just now with you! If you have an advertisement you would like to blast out to tons of websites via their contact forms in the U.S. or anywhere in the world let me know, I can even target specific niches and my pricing is very low. Reply here: Benja57mik57@gmail.com]]></description>
